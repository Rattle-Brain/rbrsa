# Rattle-Brain RSA

## Description

Fully fledged RSA implementation in C. This project was created for me to learn more about RSA and how it works. Turns out it's more complicated than I first thought.

This project is a work in progress.

I'm basing this algorithm on the official standard [PKCS #1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017) and the [FIPS 186-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf) standard.
